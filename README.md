Site to share python code to read comma separated production history export files originated from IHS database.

The program xxxxx.py creates three (3) comma separated files:
- Header file with general information and geographical coordinates of the wells.
- Monthly Production history for wells contained in the header file.
- Production Tests for wells.

Those files are created in such a way that their format can be easily uploaded to any relational database.

The purpose of this exercise is two fold:

1 - Learn Python by doing some coding
2 - Use the files produced by the python programs in some analysis using R

Final purpose of all this practice is to be able to identify some trends, common patterns, correlations and posibly some causation of what could be the performance signature of a group of wells.

As of today I have been taking some courses for the certification in Data Mining and Data Science and this data could potentially be of use for a proposed project I could outline from the analysis of the data.

Suggestions, comments and constructive and positive feedback will be welcome !!!
